### THIS BRANCH OF THIS APP IS FOR ANDROID ONLY
This app uses Redux and react-native-async-storage (See src/features/test for example usage)
and NativeWind, a Tailwind adapter for React Native.

## Getting started:

### On Android:
Download the Expo Go app on the play store

### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the Dev server on a physical device

OK, this is the really cool part. First: 
```
npx expo start
```
Then, 
on Android, go into the Expo Go app and pick the option to scan QR code.

### OR

Set up a virtual Android device according to respective docs.

### Start editing and see the app change! 

If it doesn't auto-reload, press 'r' in the dev server terminal window.
