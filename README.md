## Getting started:

### On Android:
Download the Expo Go app on the play store

### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the Dev server on a physical device

OK, this is the really cool part. First: 
```
npx expo start
```
Then, 
on Android, go into the Expo Go app and pick the option to scan QR code.

### OR

### Run the Dev server on a virtual device

Set up the virtual Android or iOS device according to respective docs.

Run the Expo command pertinent to send the app to the virtual device (a for Android or i for iOS)

### Start editing and see the app change! 

If it doesn't auto-reload, press 'r' in the dev server terminal window.
